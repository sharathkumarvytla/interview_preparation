# What is Angular
- Angular is javascript UI frameword, It is help to develop single page applications by using the concept of components and routing

# Diff between Angular JS & Angular
- Angular JS used JavaScript, Angular used TypeScript
- Angular JS Architecture is Controller based, Angular Architecture is Component based
- Angular JS doesn't support CLI, Angular support CLI
- Angular JS doesn't support mobile application, Angular support mobile application
- Angular JS deosn't support server side, Angular support server side
- Angular Js doesn't provide lazy loading, Angular provide lazy loading

# What are the directives in Angular
- In angular we have 3 types of directives
- 1.Structural directives 2.Attribute directives 3.Component directives
- Structural directives : ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch  Attribute directives : NgStyle, NgClass Component directives : It is like class we can write @Component decorate for class

# What is the importance of NPM & Node Module Folder
- NPM stands for Node Package Manager used to install any java script framework in NPM folder from GIT hub

# Importance of package.json file
- It is contains the all installed java script framework dependencies

# What is type script
- Type script is super set of java script, and it is stricly typed(While creating variable we must be declare type of variable)
- Type script also provide object oriental programing environment

# Importance of Angular CLI
- CLI stands for Command Line Interface, We can create project  or create components or create decorators or ect using CLI

# What is component
- Component is simple call class we can declare class as component using @Component decorator on top of the class
- Component is like buiding model object into view
- Every Component have type, css, html and spect file. using selector tag we can use component in anywhere (We can perform SAP using selector tag)
- Group of components we can call Module

# What is decorator (We can call decorators as annotations or metadata)
- Decorate is like tell the type of class
- If we want to create component then we use @Component decorator on top of the class then is it component
- If we want to create module then we use @NgModel decorator then is it angular module

# What is template
- Templete is HTML view in angular, we can manage DOM elements and HTML layout using directives
- In component we can declare template file name using template url tag or else we can write inline code in component file

# What are the type of databinding in angular
- One Way Data Binding : String interpolation {{}}
- Two Way Data Binding : [{ngModel}]
- Property Data Binding : [value], [hidden], [disable]
- Event Data Binding : (click)="onClick()" (keyUp)="keyUp()" (mourseOver)="mouseOver()"

# Angular Architecture
1.Template : The HTML view of Angular
2.Component : Binds the View and Model
3.Modules : Groups components logically
4.Binding : Defined how view and component communicate
5.Directive : Change the HTML DOM behaviour
6.Service : Helpt to share common login across the project
7.DI : Dependency injection is help to inject instance across constructor

# What is SPA
- SPA stands for Single Page Application
- It is used to update the some part of UI on demand, which means while doing any action on UI only perficular component only will refresh
- We can perform SPA using routing. routing is used to call(route) the componet using URL then that component will refresh into Template page
- We have to write <router-outlet></router-outlet>, then only redirect into routing URL component
- We can navitage route HTML template using [routeLink]  anchor tag and in component file we can use route.navitage('/home')

# How exactly route implemented in Angular
- We can create unique route link in path for every component and using path value(url) we can call components across project

# What is Lazy loading in Angular
- Lazy loading means on demand loading nothing but loading neccesary components, HTML, CSS

# How to create lazy loading in Angular
- For perfoming Lazy loading we need to follow 2 steps
1. We have to develop application in different modules
2. We have to use loadChildren in app.route module

# What are services in angular
- Using  service we can share common functionality across angular project
- Like login validation we can implemnt is service and share functionality into across project

# Dependency Injection in Angular

# Diff ngServe & ngBuild
- ngServe is used to build inMemory(inside RAM) and ngBuild is used to build in HardDisk(It will create dist folder on HardDisk)
- While moving to production we can use ngBuild command
