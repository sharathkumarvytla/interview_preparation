# What is Angular
- Angular is binding framework, which is binds the HTML UI and Javascript model, And angular will building a single-page client application
- Angular will take of many aspects of frontend web applications such as HTTP requests, routing, layout, forms, reactivity, validation, etc.

# Diff between angular JS and angular
- Angular js is used Javascript, angular use Typescript
- Angular js architercture is Controller, angular is component
- Angular js is not supports mobile application, angular can support mobile applications
- Angular js could not have CLI, angular have CLI(commmnad line interface)
- Angular js could not supports server side application, angular can support server side application

# What is DOM
- DOM stands for Document Object Model, it contains page's information
- Based on angular directives it can binding data into attributes, elements etc

# What is directives in angular
- Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in Angular applications. Based on directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

# What are the directives we have in angular ^
-In angular we have three kinds of directives:
1.Component Directive

2.Structural directives 
Ex: ngFor - this directive is used to repeats a portion of the HTML template once per each item from an iterable list (Collection). 
    Ex: <tr *ngFor="let customer of customers;">
        <td>{{customer.customerNo}}</td>
        <td>{{customer.name}}</td>
        <td>{{customer.address}}</td>
        </tr>
    ngSwitch - this directive is used to add/remove HTML elements depending on a match expression.
    Ex: <div [ngSwitch]="Switch_Expression"> 
        <div *ngSwitchCase="MatchExpression1”> First Template</div>
        <div *ngSwitchCase="MatchExpression2">Second template</div> 
        <div *ngSwitchCase="MatchExpression3">Third Template</div> 
        <div *ngSwitchDefault?>Default Template</div>
        </div>
    ngIf - this directive is used to add or remove HTML elements based on an expression. The expression must return a boolean value. 
    Ex:  <div *ngIf="condition"> 
         This is shown if condition is true
         </div>

3. Attribute Directives
Ex: ngModel - this directive is used the perform the two-way data binding.
    ngClass - this directive is used to add or remove the CSS classes from an HTML element.
    ngStyle - This directive is used to change the multiple style properties of our HTML elements.

# What is NPM
- NPM stand for node package manager, which is used to import and install packages into local or global folders
- Once package will download we can check in nod_module folder, nod_module folder contains all imported packges
- Ex: NPM(npm) install package-name

# What is package.json
- It is a root director of Node.js, which contains all javascripts packages informations

# What is Typescript ^
- It is a superset of javaScript, it added types of javaScript
 
# What is Angular CLI
- CLI stands for Command Line Interface, we can create new project from CLI very easiely, no need to do install and configure manually
- And by using we can create components, services, pipes, directives and more. Also it helps in building, serving, testing etc
- steps to create project using CLI
1. npm install -g @angular/cli’ -which will install CLI globally on machine.
2. ng new MyNewApp -which is create new angular project
3. ng serve -which is use to deploy applition locally, It starts up a local development server

# What are the importance of Component and Modules
- Module is collections of component, serivce, pipe, And every component is collection of HTML Template, typeScript code, service and pipe

# What is Decorator in angular
- Decorator defines what kind of class is it. for example if you decorate @Component then it says its an angular component, if you put @NgModule it becomes a angular   module

# What are annotations and metadata
- 

# What is a template
- Template is an HTML view of Angular in which we can write directives. 
- There are two ways to defined template
  1. Inline 2. Seperate HTML File

# What are the databinding in angular
- Data binding defines how the view and component communicate with each other, There are four types of bindings in angular
1. Expresion / Interpolation {{}} :- Data flow from component to the view and we can mix the same with HTML Tag 
2. Property Binding [] :- Data flow from component to view
3. Event Binding () :- When you want to send event from view to component
4. Two-way Binding [()] :- Data flow from component to view and vice versa
