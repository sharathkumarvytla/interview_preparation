# Java
- Java is object oriental programing language, it is an high level, secured and open source programing language

# What is object orientel
- In java everything in object only, means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects

# Type of java application
- Standalone application
- Web application
- Enterprice application
- Mobile application

# What is standalone applcation
- Standalone application is like desktop application, means standalone application will perform in same machine with user interface
- Mobile applications also like standalone applications

# What is distributed application
- Distributed application are run on server only, user will connect using web application url
- Based on url user will get UI pages, user will perform operations according

# What is Http and FTP
- Http(Hyper tech transfer protocol) is used to access the website on the internet
- FTP(File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer file from one host to another

# Stateless and Statefull Protocol
- Stateless doesn't maintain any user request information in sessions
- Statefull will maintain user request informations in sessions, and if user required request information then we can send using session object

# What are the features in java
1. Simple
- Java is simple programing language
2. PlantForm Independent
- We can run program on any plateform
3. Portable
- We can carry java byte code into any plateform without doing any changes
4. Secure
- Java was not communicates directly with machine(Operating System), first convert into byte code then
  jvm will convert into machine code. so if have any issues with byte code then jvm will not convert into machine code
  this is also called compiled time error with syntax
5. Object operiented pragraming language
- Java is an object oriental programing language, bcoz everything we handle in terms of object only
6. MultiThreading
- Java can provide inbuilt support for multithreading by providing rich apis
- In the case of multithreading, multithread can run simultaniously and can perform specific task symultaniuosly
7. Distributed

# What is happend in comipile time
- At compile time, the Java file is compiled by Java Compiler (It does not interact with OS) and converts the Java code into bytecode

# What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, it is used to read byte code line by line and convert into nagative understanding formate of OS(Operating System)
- Steps to follow convert byte to os
  1. Load code
  2. Verifies code
  3. Execute code
  4. Provide runtime environment

# What is JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- It is used to provide run time environment for java application

# What is JDK (Java Development Kits)
- It is used to develop java applications

# What is JIT (Just In Time)
- JVM will read byte code in line by line, so it will take more time to read byte code line by line and convertinto OS
- So over come this problem we use JIT
- JIT is used to read entire byte code at once and convert into netive understand permate of OS

# What is Garbage Collection
- It is used to find the unused objects and delete then to reclaim memory

# What is Identifiers in java
- A name in java program is defualt considered as identifier, which is used to identification purpose
- It can be class name or method name or variable name or label name
- In java some idenfier are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning of each reseverd identifier are called reseverd words

# What is variable
- varible is hold the value, we can assing variable using data type
- we have 3 types of varialble
1. local variable
- If we declare varible inside method, then those methods are calles local variable
2. instance variable
- If we declare varicale inside class and outside of methods with non-static is called instance variable
3. static varicale
- If we declare varicale inside class and outside of methods with static is called static variable

# What is variable declaration and initialization
- variable declaration means we coudn't given any value for variable(we are not assign any values for variable)
Ex: int a;
- Varible initialization means we will assign value for variable
Ex: int a=10;

# What is Data Type
- Data type is declare varible type, which mean our variable values as primitive or non- primitive data type
- Data types are two type
1. Primitive data type
- The primitive data types are boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2. Non primitive data type
- The non-primitive data types are Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays
- String also comes under non-primitive data type, becoz String is an object

# Java Control Statement
- provides statements that can be used to control the flow of Java code. Such statements are called control flow statements. 
  It is one of the fundamental features of Java, which provides a smooth flow of program
- Decision Making statements
  if statements
  switch statement - if several options are available then it is not recomended to use if-else, we should use switch
- Loop statements
  do while loop - if we want to execute loop body at lease once then we should go for do-while
  while loop - if we dont know the no of iterations in advance then best loop is while loop
  for loop - this is most commonly used loop and best suitable if we know the no of iterations in advance
  for-each loop
- Jump statements
  break statement
  continue statement

# What is new and newInstance()
- new is a key word used to create an object for class, if we know the class name before create an object then we go for new keyword
- newInstance() is used to create an object for class, if we want to create instance(object) with out knowing class name then we go for use it

# What is homogenius and hetrogenius
- Homegenius means same type of object, like array can support only homogeius
- Hetrogenius mean different types of objects, like array coudn't support hetrogenius values

# What is array 
- An array used to store the hohmogenius data in index value
- In array we can't change size of array once array is created
- we must be know(decide) the size of array before creating

# What is Iterable and Iterator
- The target element in forEach loop should be Iterable
- We can use iteraor to get objects one by one from the collection

# Declarations and access modifiers
- Whenever we write code, we must be give information about classes and methods and variables for JVM
1. public
- we can use public modifier at class level and method level
- if we declase class as public, we can access that classs from within package and out side of package also
2. defualt
- it is class level modifier
- it is defualt type, we can access classs within package only, but cann't access from out side of package
3. final
- we can use final modifier at class level, method level
- if we use method as final, child class coud not override that method (mean if A class have final sum(), now in B class extends A class, but we cann't possible to overriden sum() in B class)
- if we use final for class, we can not create child class means(if i creating Studnet class as final modifer, and also create College classs and try to extends Student class into College class
  so here we cannt extends class mean we cann't do inheritance concept)
4. abstarct
- we can use abstract modifier at class level, method level and varible level.
- parent class abstract method doest have any implementation, but parent class tell to guidlines into child class. which mean if am creating Student class, in this class have one abstract method
  is called studentLogin method. now i have another method is called StudentReg class so now am extends Student class for StudentReg. so must be override abstract class and implementation required
  implmentaions
- if we want to not allowed to create an object for java class, then we declare class as abstract class. then we could not create object for that class
5. private
- we can use private modifier for method and veriable level
- If we use private modifier we cann't access out side of class
6. protected
- we can use at method level and variable level, but we cann't use class level
- we can access within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

# What Static Modifier
- We can use static modifer for varible and methods but not classes
- In instace variable for every object superate copy will created, but static variable only one copy will be created at class level. mean at class level only variable 
  must be declarete and initialise

# What is synchronized
- Synchronized is modifier at method and blocks, but we cann't use at classes and variable
- It is used to allow only one thread at a time and execute given response
- The main advantage of synchronize modifier is to resolve data inconsistancy problem
- The disadvantage of synchonize modifier is increase waiting time for remaining thread and reduce performance of application

# What is OOPs
- OOPs stands for object oriental programing language. java provide few oops concepts like
1. Object
- An entity have states and behaviour is know as object, we can defined instance of class is called object
- We can create object for using new key word, or using newInstance(), while create object it will allocate some memeory space for storing object data
2. Class
- A class is blurprint or prototype from which object are created.
- Every class containns set of properties or methods
3. Abstraction
- Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
  For example we have data package provided by java, we just use our required methods. but we dont know the internal logics of methods
4. Encapsulation
- It is bunding filed(variables), methods inside a single class is called encapsulation
5. Inheritance
- It is used to call/get some functionalotity from one class to another class, like parent class to child class
- we have diffrent way of inheritance
- advatage of thise is code reusability
   1. Single inheritance
- Here Child class can get features from parent class
Ex:
  class Parent{
  }
  class Child extends Parent{
  // Here child class can get parent class features
  }
   2. MultiLevel inheritance
- Here child2 class can get features from child1 class, And child1 class can get features from Parent class
Ex:
  class Parent{
  }
  class Child1 extends Parent{
  // Here child1 class get features from Parent
  }
  class Child2 extends Child1{
  // Here child2 class get features from Child1
  }
   3. hierarcal inheritance
- Here child1 class get features from parent class, And child2 class get features from parent class
Ex:
  class Parent{
  }
  class child1 extends Parent{
  // Here child1 class get features from Parent class
  }
  class child2 extends Parent{
  // Here child2 class get features from Parent class
  }

   4. Multiple inheritance
   5. Hybrid inheritance
Note: Multiple and Hybrid inheritance will supports for interface only

6. Polymorphism
- One task can perform multiple ways, like in my code i writen code for write data on csv file using input like arrayList object and filename
- In that method will work on any type of data like student informtaion data, customer information data, or any invalid data
- In jave method overloading and overriding also achieve polymorphism 
- In java we have two type of polymorphism
  1. compiletime polymorphism - It is nothing but method overloading, that means method overload treat like compiletime polymorphim, bcoz we will pass parameters before run the application
  2. runtime polymorphism - It is nothing but method overriding, that means method overriding treat like runtime polymorphism, bcoz we will execute rebuild method at runtime

# What is method in java
- A method is a collection of statement that perform some specific task and return result to caller
- The advantage of method is to use reusability
- Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
- Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
- Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
- Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only 
  from the same package only
- Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method 
  does not return anything, we use void keyword
- Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, 
  if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name must be subtraction(). A method is invoked by its name
- Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name. 
  If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank
- Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.

# Types of Method in java
There are two types of methods in Java:
1. Predefined Method
- This methods is given by java library, just we can use method and get functionality of methods
2. User-defined Method
- This method is written by developer, These methods are modified according to the requirement.

# Instnace and Static methods in java
1. Instance method are methods which require an object of its class to be created before it can be called. Static methods are the methods in Java that can be 
   called without creating an object of class.
2. Static method is declared with static keyword. Instance method is not with static keyword.
3. Static method means which will exist as a single copy for a class. But instance methods exist as multiple copies depending on the number of instances created 
   for that class.
4. Static methods can be invoked by using class reference. Instance or non static methods are invoked by using object reference.
5. Static methods can’t access instance methods and instance variables directly. Instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.

# What is this key worked in java
- In java this keyword can be used to refer the current object in a method or constructor.
- The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion if we use same name attributes in class and constructor or methods

# What is super key word in java
- In java super key word can be used to refer the parent class variable and methods in child class
- For example, if i want to get Student class variable values or method in StudentReg class. then we use super key word

# What is super() in java
- In java super() used to call parent class constuctor only

# Constructor
- To perform intialization operations of an object using constructors
- In constructor we can initialize object, but we cann't create object
- In java we have two type of constructor
  1. defualt constructor
  2. parameterized constructor

# What is Is-A and Has-A relation
- In Is-A is nothing but inheritance. means one class can depende another class loosely, so in inheritance we can get one class methods/functionality in another class
  using IS-A relations only. bcoz in inhentance strictly loosely couple
- In Has-A is we can follow tightly couple. like I have one studentInfo class and another one is StudentLogin, And before instantiate object for StudentLogin class must be instantial
  StudentInfo. bcoz here without student info we can't to login. so StudentLogin class will depend on StudentInfo class lightly it is called Hash-A relation

# What is wrapper class
- Wrapper class is nothing but to convert from primitive datatype into object or object into primitive
- so her we need a some classes for convertion like int for Integer, boolen for Boolen, double for Double. so this classes are called wrapper classes 

# What is method overloading and method overriding
- If both methods having same name but different argument typs is called method overloading
Ex: public class Student{
    public void Cal(int val1, int val2){
    //here 2 argument are int type only
    }
    public void Cal(int val1, double val2){
    //here first argument are int and second argument are double type
    }
    }
- Whenever we inheritate from parent class into child class, we can get method also from parent class. so now my requirement is not suitable for existing parent class implmentation
  so what am doing, based on requirement am trying to reimplement in same method.
- So here we assume parent class method  name is Culc(), so in child class am define the same method. that mean Parent Calc() is overrid in child class
Ex: Public class Student{
    public void regis(int id, String name){
    // Some implementation
    }
    }
    Public class Facult extends Student{
    public void regis(int id, String name){   // In Facult method regis method is overrided from Student class
    // Some implementation
    }
    }

# What id data binding
- Which mean when we call method from class reference it is called data binding
- we have two type of data binding
  1. static data binding- Is-A relations ship like static data binding only, bcoz her we can bind data at compile time
  2. dynamic data binding- Has-A relations ship like dynamic data binding only, bcoz her we can bind data at run time

# What is String buffer and String builder
- Both are used to change String object as mutable
- In string buffer it is thread safe means internally follow synchronized, so at a time only one thread can allow. perfomrance wise is slow
- In string builder is non thread safe mean inernally is not follow synchonized, perromance wise is speed


# What is exeception
- While executing progarme if have any issue with buisiness login then next process will terminate means not execute complete task 
- so in thise case we must be handle that exception using try catch blocks
1. checked exception
- compile will check before run whether need to handle any exception for runtime level. those exceptions are called checked exception
Ex: File Not Found Exception

2. unchecked exception
- which exceptions are compiler will not checked those exceptions are called unchecked exception
- Here programer only will handle the exception using try and catch bock and using throws keyword
Ex: Artthmetic Exception
    Null pointer Exception (E: A NullPointerException (NPE) is a common runtime exception in Java that occurs when your code tries to use an object reference that hasn't been initialized (i.e., it points to null). 
    This means you're trying to perform an operation (like calling a method, accessing a field, or passing it as an argument) on an object that doesn’t actually exist in memory, as it's represented by null)

Note: Whether checked or unchecked both exception will come on runtime, but not in compile time

# What is throw and throws keyword
- throw keyword is used to throw the exception explicitly into catch block, we can write throw key work withing body
- throws keyword is used to declare exception type on method level, once that exception will accured in try block then will throw into catch block, here we write
  throws beside of method 

# What is collection and collections
- collection is a fw, to represent group of individual object in single entity then we use collection
- collections is unility class, it is from java.util.package. it contains some method like soring, serching ect. so we can user those method using collections class

# diff between array and collection
- Array:
  1. it is a fixed size, we can't change array size once intialization is done
  2. it can allow only homogenuis values (mean same type of values)
  3. deost have any standard underline data structures
  4. it is good for performance wise
- Collection:
  1. It is growable nature, which means dynamicaly assign arraysize depends on requirement
  2. It can allow homogenius and hetreogenius values
  3. internally it can follow some standard underline data structures
  4. peroformance wise it is poor
  
# Collection in java
- If we want to represent a ground of individual object in single entity then we should go for collection
- List(I) : imllementation classes are ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
  1. duplicate values are allowed and insertion order preserved
  - ArrayList (C) : 1. Uderline data structure for arraylist is growable array
                    2. best choice for user retrival operation is very faster in arraylist
                    3.  worst choice for insert/delete oprations,bcoz when insert/delete tha entire values will we shipted
                    4. It is internally use Random Access interface
  - LinkedList (C) : 1. Underline data structore for LinkedList is double linked list
                     2. best choice for inser/delete operations
                     3. worst choice for frequent retrival operations
		     4. It doest not use Random Access interface
  - Vector (C)     : 1. vecotor is synchronized
                     2. vectory is thread safe
                     3. performace is low
                     4. doest not support enumeration and iterator

- Set(I) : implementation classes are HashSet, LinkedHashSet
  1. duplcate values are not allowed and insertion order not preserved
  - HashSet (C) : 1. underline data structure for hashset is hashtable
                  2. It is not follow insertion order, but duplicates are not allowed
                  3. It can allow null value only once		
                  4. Performance wise is slightly faster then linked hash set

  - LinkedHashSet(C) : 1. underline data structure for linked hash set is hashtable and double linke list
                       2. It is follow insertion order, but duplicates are not allowed
                       3. It can allow null value only once
                       4. Performance wise is slow then hash set

- SortedSet(I) : it is a implemented from Set Interface And implementation class is Tress set
  1. duplicate values are not allowed, insertion order not preserved but follow some sorting order
  - TreeSet(C) : It is an implementation class for SortedSet inteface
                 1. Duplicates are not allowed, insertion order is not follow but follow some sorting order (like assending or desending order)
                 2. duplicate values are not allowed
                 3. best choice for ritrival operations

- Queue(I) : If we want to represent a group of individual object prior to process then we user queue interface, Implementaion class are 
             priority queue, blocking queue

- Map(I) : If we want to represent a group of individual object in key, value  pair then we user Map
           Implementation classes are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, Identity HashMap, WeekHashMap
  - HashMap(C) - 1. hashmap is not follow insertion order
                 2. duplicate key are not follow, but it can allow duplicate value
                 3. null key are allowed only one time
  - LinkedHashMap(C) - 1. linkedhashmap is follow insertion order 
                       2. duplicate key are not follow, but it can allow duplicate value
                       3. null key are allowed only one time
                       
     

- SortedMap(I) : If we want to represent a group of key values pairn acourding to some sorting order then we use this interface
                 implementation classes are TreeMap
  - TreeMap(C) : Tree Map is an implemeted class for SortedMap interface
                 1. duplicats are not allowed, insertion order is not preseved, but follow some sorting order

# What is comparable and compartor interfaces
- If we want to follow defualt natural sorting order then we for comparable interface
  her default sroting mean like 
  1. Number - defult soring is assending order
  2. String - defulat soring is albhanumeriacal(a to z)
  3. here we use compareTo(Object) method
- If we want to follow customized sorting order then we for comparator interface
  1. here we compare(Object obj1, Object obj2) method

# How to iterate collection object 
- we have 3 interfaces for iterate collection object in one by one
1. Enumeration(I)
2. Iterator(I)
3. ListIterator(I)

# What is collections class
- It is a utitlity class to deffined serveral utility nmethods from collection object
